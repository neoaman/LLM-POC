However, in the Production section below, we demonstrate how to pass the `env_manager` argument to the method for loading the saved MLflow model, which tells MLflow what tooling to use to recreate the environment.\n",

MLflow saves these libraries and versions alongside the logged model; see the [MLflow docs on model storage](https://mlflow.org/docs/latest/models.html#storage-format) for more information.  While using Databricks for this course, you can also generate an example inference notebook which includes code for setting up the environment; see [the model inference docs](https://docs.databricks.com/machine-learning/manage-model-lifecycle/index.html#use-model-for-inference) for batch or streaming inference for more information."
